# Hack-Oxford
Repository for HackOxford 2018      In too Deep / In2Deep

What do we need:

- Data: Either survey or generated (has to be realistic)

- Read data and parse it: AWS Machine Learning

- Database it and be able to fetch: We need closed categories where possible


Cool features:

- Study buddy (If their background is similar / General interests: Twitter? --- Are they a real person? Compare Tweets for interests )

- Give funny advice so person is not sad (Funny mode?)

- Create graphs of whole distribution and being able to look at them (fetch ...)

- Have direct links to resources (book on Amazon, video on YouTube, course on EdX, Coursera, etc) and generate statistics for the usablity of each for future users (as recommendations)

- Measure how useful Notes/Recommended books were versus videos, online courses and blog posts in order to help educators restructure course material and make it more interactive.
